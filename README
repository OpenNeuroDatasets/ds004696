# Task Description
Patients were resting in the hospital bed, while single pulse stimulation was performed. The stimulation had a duration of 200 microseconds, was biphasic and had an amplitude of 6mA. For subject 7 stimulation amplitude was sometimes reduced to 4mA to minimize interictal responses.


# Code
Code to analyses these data is available at: https://github.com/MultimodalNeuroimagingLab/HAPwave



# Dataset
This data is organized according to the Brain Imaging Data Structure specification (BIDS version 1.12.0). A community- driven specification for organizing neurophysiology data along with its metadata. For more information on this data specification, see https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
Each subject has their own folder (e.g., ‘sub-01’) containing intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings from 8 patients during single pulse electrical stimulation, as well as the metadata needed to understand the raw data and event timing.


# Acknowledgements
This project was funded by the National Institute Of Mental Health of the National Institutes of Health Brain Initiative under Award Number R01 MH122258, “CRCNS: Processing speed in the human connectome across the lifespan". The overall goal of this project is to develop a large database of single pulse stimulation data and develop tools to advance our understanding of the human connectome across the lifespan. The data was collected by Dora Hermes, Nick Gregg, Brian Lundstrom, Cindy Nelson, Gabriela Ojeda Valencia, Gregg Worrell and Kai J. Miller. The BIDS formatting was performed by Dora Hermes and Gabriela Ojeda Valencia.
